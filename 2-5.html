                        <p class=" stacked-description">What are some easy ways to be kind? Say hi to your friend. Be nice to your puppy. If you see someone fall down, maybe you can help them up! How about sharing your cookies or crackers? Or giving a tired someone a ride in your little wagon? From taking turns to saying you’re sorry, trying not to be angry to giving a big hug, these simplest of gestures, rendered in Jane Cowen-Fletcher’s adorable style, show that being kind feels so good that even a baby will want to try it.</p>

                        <h2 class="card-title"><strong>This Is a Book of Shapes</strong><br><em>By: Kenneth Kraegel</em></h2>
                        <p class="card-description">First comes the circle. Then the square and the triangle. Then the . . . emu pushing a pancake wagon down a hill? What begins as a concept book about everyone’s geometric favorites soon defies expectations with a series of funny and imaginative twists. Award-winning author-illustrator Kenneth Kraegel pairs a deadpan text with simple wood-grained shapes, interspersed with vibrant illustrations of animals engaged in hilariously absurd pastimes. Each page turn builds on the delicious anticipation the contrast creates to make this a unique and rollicking story-time hit.</p>
