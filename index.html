            <p>This website shows my love of both books and software engineering. During this prework phase with Flatiron's SE Program, I've learned about how to think of programming as a conversation as well as build my foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope this website will show my best effort in putting all that I've learned so far into practice. Enjoy!</p>
            <p>Click on the different age groups above to see a few of my book recommdations. These are based on my own experiences as a reading teacher and mother of a toddler boy. I love finding books that are both engaging and teach life lessons to our budding readers. I hope that this is a handy resource for those who are looking for a few tried tried and true books for a few different age groups.</p>
